# New York City Tree Database
This is one of my projects for my data structures class taught by Professor Joanna Klukowska.

There was an initial project which was to create a searchable database of every tree in New York City using
public data available on https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees. 

The initial project specified arraylists as the main data structure in which to store the tree data. 


This project uses a more efficient algorithm to search tree data and uses other data structures such as hash maps.


I really enjoyed working on this project.


Cheers.
